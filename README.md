# dotfiles

ðŸ«ƒ behavior dotfiles featuring:

- A barely working XFWM4-without-XFCE4 setup.
- My noise-cancelled-microphone batteries-included Pipewire setup.
- Slightly edited default configs for Dunst, Alacritty, and more.
- A `.zshrc` held together with duct tape and huffed glue.
- A buncha other scripts I don't even use anymore.
- A HUGE history. I even had a 1000+ line `init.el` here sometime......

## Usage

Install the scripts with:

```bash
stow -R -t ~ scripts
```

Installing everything else is just... the same invocation.
