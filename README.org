* dotfiles

The 4th iteration of my dotfiles repository. This time, we're going
Arch.

** Structure

- [[system]] is installed into the root of the filesystem. It contains
non-sensitive configuration files.
- [[scripts]] contains scripts of my own creation.
- [[shell]] is my Bash configuration.
- [[emacs]] is my EXWM setup with its supplemental [[emacs/.xinitrc][.xinitrc]].
- [[mpd]] includes my MPD and =mpdscribble= configuration.

** Installation

Symlink management is done with =stow=, and it is the preferred way of
installation. Example script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  stow -t ~ emacs mpd shell scripts
  sudo stow -t / system
#+END_SRC

You might have to delete the original files before running either of
these commands.
