* dotfiles

The new and updated dotfiles for my Windows 10 setup. All the unused
code from my Linux configuration has been moved to [[legacy]].

Currently available are an Emacs init-file and a semi-working, seldom
used MPD service.

[[install.bat]] is responsible for doing the installation. Run it at your
own risk! It may break nothing, or maybe everything.

There isn't much to see as of now; I am no Windows poweruser.
