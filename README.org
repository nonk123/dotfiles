* dotfiles

The 4th iteration of my dotfiles repository. This time, we're going
Arch.

** Structure

[[system]] is installed into the root of the filesystem. It contains
non-sensitive configuration files.

[[scripts]] contains scripts of my own creation. They're not that good
though.

[[shell]] is the shell configuration, currently for =bash=.

[[sway]] and [[emacs]] contain the respective configuration files.

[[misc]] is configuration files that don't fit anywhere else.

** Installation

Symlink management is done with =stow=; it is the preferred way of
installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  stow -t ~ sway emacs shell scripts misc
  sudo stow -t / system
#+END_SRC

You might have to delete the original files before running either of
these commands.
